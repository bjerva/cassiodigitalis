# cassiodigitalis

This archive contains the code used in 'Word Embeddings Pointing the Way for Late Antiquity' within the Cassiodigitalis project (http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W15/W15-3708.pdf).

If you intend to use this code, please let me know and be aware that some clean-up would be in order.

TODO:
 * Clean up code
 * Document code
 * Upload latin vector archive
